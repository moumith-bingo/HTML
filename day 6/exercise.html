<h1>What is rainbow?</h1>
<p class="ab">A rainbow is sunlight spread into spectrum of colors and diverted to the eye of the observer by water droplet. The <b>"bow"</b>
part of the world refers to the fact that rainbow is group of nearly circular arcs of color all having a common center</p>
<h1>What makes the bow?</h1>
<p class="ab">The main ingredients to see a rainbow are the following</p>
<p class="mmm"><ul>
  <li>You need to be standing with the sun to your back and the rain in front of you</li>
    <li>The sun needs to be less than 42<sup>0</sup> above the horizon</li>
    <li>The sun's rays must be hitting the raindrops to create the rainbow</li>
</ul></p>
<h1>Why do people in Ireland believe  there was gold at the end of rainbows</h1>
<p class="bb">Even as far back as 17th century,people knew that we connot see the complete circle of the rainbow. In Ireland, people in the 17<sup>th</sup> century became
fond of saying that one was likely to find a pot of gold az to find the end of the rainbow. The expression somehiw changed, and became a part of 
mythology </p>
